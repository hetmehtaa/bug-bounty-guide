#### To Find More Programs, You Can Have a Look Into Google Dorkings.





 1. Choose wisely (first not for bounty)
 2. Select a bug for hunt
 3. Exhaustive search
 4. Not straightforward always

### REPORT:

 5. Create a descriptive report
 6. Follow responsible disclosure
 7. Create POC and steps to reproduce
*******

### Words of wisdom

 1. PATIENCE IS THE KEY, takes years to master, don't fall for overnight success
 2. Do not expect someone will spoon feed you everything.
 3. Confidence
 4. Not always for bounty
 5. Learn a lot
 6. Won't find at the beginning, don't lose hope
 7. Stay focused
 8. Depend on yourself
 9. Stay updated with the infosec world


The Best skill you can have is Google. Do learn it, it's not only a search bar but more than that! do some Dorking and have tailored results that you want. You can not always be dependent on others, thus learning google is crucial. 

Thanks.
